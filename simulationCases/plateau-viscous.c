# Scalings for Plateauâ€“Rayleigh pinchoff

An inviscid cylinder of dense liquid is unstable under surface
tension forces. The initial growth of the perturbation is described
by the Rayleigh--Plateau linear stability theory. Close to pinchoff,
non-linear effects cannot be neglected and fully non-linear
solutions must be sought. Using simple similarity arguments, one can
predict that the minimum radius of the deformed cylinder should tend
toward zero as $(t_0-t)^{2/3}$ while the axial velocity should
diverge as $1/(t_0-t)^{1/3}$, with $t_0$ the time of pinchoff.

This test case verifies that these scalings can be recovered using
an axisymmetric VOF calculation.

The figure below illustrates the initial growth, pinchoff and
satellite drop formation.

The animation below shows how adaptivity is used to track the high
curvatures and short timescales close to pinchoff. Up to 18 levels of
refinement are used to capture roughly four orders of magnitude in
characteristic spatial scales.

The scalings for the minimum radius and maximum velocity are given
in the figures below, together with the
theoretical fits. The fit is excellent for at least four orders of
magnitude in timescale. The departures from the power laws close to
pinchoff are due to saturation of the spatial resolution (the
minimum value on the y-axis of the first figure is the grid size
$1/2^{18}$).
